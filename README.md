# Studio (CS 5191)

While most courses focus on _what_ to build, this practicum focuses on _how_ to build.

Each week, students gather to work side-by-side in the Cornell Tech Studio, bringing with them whatever projects or assignments they are currently designing or coding in their other courses.

As the students work, faculty and guest practitioners—including engineers and designers from local tech companies—provide instruction, review, and feedback to improve the quality of the students’ designs and code and to address any blockers or risks the students are facing. This instruction includes stand-up lectures on product and software development, design reviews, code reviews, pair programming, and more. When appropriate, review and feedback is given openly, so that all students benefit from the instruction. 

Ample time is also given for the students to make concentrated progress on their projects and assignments in an environment where peer and professional feedback is easily available.

**Spring 2014 Studio** welcomed engineers and designers from Red Antler, ADP, Palantir, Trendalytics, Google, Moat, and Redigi, and featured stand-up lectures on:
* Pair programming
* Open source software
* Post mortems
* Technical debt
* Evolutionary product development
* Bottleneck analysis
* Performance analysis
* Test-driven development
