# Studio

**Studio:** An interactive space that encourages effective communication design through creative thinking, integrative collaboration, and visual thinking.

Expertise is increasingly important as tech becomes more complex. Students must learn to put knowledge into action and the gap between education and practice can be wide. At Cornell Tech all our students practice these actions of entrepreneurship, product design, management, prototyping and more in the Studio.
